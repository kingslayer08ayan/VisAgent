VISAGENT

OVERVIEW
--------
VisAgent is an advanced multi-modal AI agent that integrates vision, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
and large language model (LLM) capabilities. It supports intelligent document ingestion, image understanding,
and context-aware question answering for research, enterprise knowledge bases, and personal assistant applications.

FEATURES
--------
- Multi-Modal Ingestion: Upload and process PDFs, images, and text files
- Vision Understanding: Analyze and interpret images
- RAG-Based Retrieval: Efficiently retrieve relevant information from a local vector store
- LLM Integration: Generate context-aware responses using GroqLLM
- FastAPI Backend: Lightweight and scalable API

ARCHITECTURE
------------
- RAGStore: Manages document ingestion and retrieval
- Vision Module: Processes and understands visual inputs
- GroqLLM: Provides advanced language understanding and generation
- StateGraph: Orchestrates workflow between components

INSTALLATION
------------
Prerequisites:
  - Python 3.10+
  - Conda (optional for environment management)

Steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/kingslayer08ayan/VisAgent.git
   cd VisAgent

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   conda create -n visagent python=3.10
   conda activate visagent

3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Download required models to ./models/:
   - all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (for embeddings)
   - GroqLLM weights (for language processing)

USAGE
-----
Start the FastAPI server:
  uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

API Endpoints:
  POST /ingest : Upload a document (PDF, TXT, or image) for processing
  POST /ask    : Submit a question or image to receive an intelligent response
